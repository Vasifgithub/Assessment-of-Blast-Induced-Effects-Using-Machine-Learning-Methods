# Peak Particle Velocity (PPV) Prediction Using Ensemble Machine Learning Models

## Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting Peak Particle Velocity (PPV), a critical measure of ground vibration generated by blasting operations in mining and construction. Ground vibrations can cause significant damage to nearby structures and ecosystems, making it essential to accurately predict PPV for safer and more efficient blasting practices.

## Data Collection

- **Source:** Mine-A, India (121 blast events).
- **Features:** Distance, stemming, burden, spacing, charge per delay, hole diameter, number of holes.
- **Target:** Peak Particle Velocity (PPV) (log-transformed).

## Machine Learning Models

This project uses ensemble learning models, which combine multiple base models for better predictive performance:

- **XGBoost**
- **Random Forest**
- **Gradient Boosting**
- **Decision Tree**

### Stacking Regressor:

- Combines the outputs of base models using **ElasticNet** as the meta-model.

### Hyperparameter Tuning:

GridSearchCV is used to tune the hyperparameters for each model:

- **XGBoost:** Learning rate, number of estimators, depth.
- **Random Forest:** Number of trees, max depth, minimum samples.
- **Gradient Boosting:** Learning rate, subsampling, depth.

## Model Performance

- **Hybrid Model:** A combination of XGBoost, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and ElasticNet achieved the best performance with an R² value of 0.974.
  
### Metrics:

- **R² (Coefficient of Determination):** Measures the goodness of fit.
- **RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error):** Measures prediction accuracy.
- **MAE (Mean Absolute Error):** Measures the average error magnitude.

## Features and Target

- **Features:** Burden, spacing, stemming, number of holes, distance, etc.
- **Target:** PPV (log-transformed).
